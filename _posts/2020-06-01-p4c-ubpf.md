# Introduction 
 
As the ecosystem around P4 continues to develop, more and more programmable targets are emerging. The P4 compiler has already support for the next-generation Linux datapath such as eBPF/XDP. However, in certain settings, it is necessary to extend user-space packet processing applications at run time. This can be achieved by using [the user-space BPF (uBPF) Virtual Machine](https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf), which is a re-implementation of in-kernel eBPF VM, and provides a user-space execution environment that is extensible at runtime.  

This blog post introduces **`p4c-ubpf`**, a new back-end for the `p4c` compiler that enables programming packet processing modules for the uBPF VM. `p4c-ubpf` makes it possible to execute the P4 code in any solution implementing the kernel bypass including DPDK, AF_XDP, and others.

# Userspace BPF for Packet Processing

## Why uBPF?

The uBPF project [1] re-implements the eBPF kernel-based Virtual Machine. It provides an eBPF assembler, disassembler, interpreter, and JIT compiler for x86-64. While BPF was originally designed to enable safe execution of code in the kernel, the uBPF project enables running BPF programs in user-space. Therefore, the uBPF Virtual Machine can be easily integrated with kernel bypass (e.g. DPDK and AF_XDP) applications.

In addition, unlike the GPL-licensed eBPF implementation, uBPF uses the Apache License version 2.0, which adds additional flexibility. Finally, the userspace eBPF uses a less complex virtual machine, which means that some constructs are not supported (e.g. tail calls), but also lifts some restrictions found in eBPF, such as the 512 byte stack-size limit. 

## P4rt-OVS

P4rt-OVS is an extension of the widely-used Open vSwitch (OVS) that integrates the BPF virtual machine into the user-space datapath. In particular, it supports injecting BPF programs at run time, making it possible to extend the packet-processing pipeline without recompiling OVS. At a technical level, BPF programs act as programmable actions and are referenced as a new OVS action (keyword `prog`) in the OpenFlow tables. The actions may read and write persistent maps (hash tables) to maintain per-flow state, and they may also write to packet headers. The `p4c-ubpf` architecture model exposes a broad range of P4 features including stateful registers.

# Compiling P4 to uBPF

The P4-to-uBPF compiler follows the same convention as other eBPF and XDP `p4c` backends. That is, the P4 program is first translated to a representation in C, which is then compiled to BPF using `clang`. This design is modular, as the P4-to-C compiler does not need to generate low-level BPF instructions. 

```
            ------------              ---------
P4_16 --->  | p4c-ubpf | ---> C ----> | clang | --> uBPF
            ------------              ---------
```

The architecture model for P4c-uBPF is depicted below. It consists of a single parser, a match-action pipeline, and a deparser.

The p4c-ubpf compiler provides also a library of *extern* functions that implement features not directly supported in the P4 language. These functions can be called from the P4 program as a normal action. The architecture model supports operations such as hash functions, stateful registers, timestamps, and checksums. The full specification of the architecture model can be seen at [this link](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/backends/ubpf/p4include/ubpf_model.p4). 

## Translating P4 to C

The main operation performed by p4c-ubpf is translating from P4 to C. The following tables provide a brief summary of how each P4 construct is mapped to a corresponding C construct. Note that the translation is very similar to `p4c-ebpf` and `p4c-xdp`.

#### Translating parsers

P4 Construct | C Translation
----------|------------
`header`  | `struct` type with an additional `valid` bit
`struct`  | `struct`
parser state  | code block
state transition | `goto` statement
`extract` | load/shift/mask data from packet buffer

#### Translating match-action pipelines

P4 Construct | C Translation
----------|------------
table     | eBPF map
table key | `struct` type
table `actions` block | tagged `union` with all possible actions
`action` arguments | `struct`
table `reads` | eBPF map's lookups
`action` body | code block
table `apply` | `switch` statement
registers  | additional eBPF map
register `reads` | eBPF map's lookups
register `writes` | eBPF map's updates

#### Translating deparsers

P4 Construct | C Translation
----------|------------
`apply` block  | code block + adjusting packet's size
`emit` operation | header's validity check + write/shift/mask data to packet buffer

# p4c-ubpf vs. other BPF-related compilers

Compared to other compilers from P4 to BPF, `p4c-ebpf` generates programs for the Linux TC subsystem and `p4c-xdp` targets the XDP kernel hook, whereas `p4c-ubpf` generates user-space code. There are several differences in functionality that these P4 backends support. The table below provides a brief comparison. 

#### Comparsion of features provided by p4c-ebpf, p4c-xdp and p4c-ubpf

|               Feature              | p4c-ebpf | p4c-xdp | p4c-ubpf |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|          Packet filtering          |    YES   |   YES   |    YES   |
| Packet's modifications & tunneling |    NO    |   YES   |    YES   |
|      Simple packet forwarding      |    YES   |   YES   |    YES   |
|              Registers             |    NO    |   NO    |    YES   |
|              Counters              |    YES   |   YES   |    NO    |
|        Checksum computation        |    NO    |   YES   |    YES   |

# Summary

The uBPF backend for the P4 compiler supports applications that processes packets in user space. It has already been used to implement various simple applications such as a stateful firewall, a rate limiter, and GTP tunneling. When used in tandem with P4rt-OVS, `p4c-ubpf` makes it possible to implement new network protocols---something that is not currently supported by Open vSwitch. See [this link](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/master/backends/ubpf/examples) for more examples. 

We encourage community to start playing with uBPF backend, report bugs and propose new enhancements. For questions or comments, please send an email to tomasz.osinski2@orange.com.
