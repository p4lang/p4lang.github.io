# P4 Becomes a Project Hosted by ONF

MENLO PARK, Calif., April 9, 2019– The Open Networking Foundation
(ONF) today announced that it completed the combination with P4.org,
and will host all P4 activities and working groups moving forward. The
ONF will bring the P4 work under its umbrella of operator-led open
source SDN projects, and, as with all ONF projects, the ONF will aim
to strategically align P4 activities with the Linux Foundation to
advance our shared mission of promoting open source as a tool for
transformation and innovation. The P4 project will continue to operate
as before with minimal disruption while benefiting from strategic
alignment with ONF and from ONF’s operational infrastructure and
expertise.

“The entire ONF team is extremely pleased to be joining with the P4
community to grow our combined ecosystem. We see great synergy between
all the ONF projects and P4, and our Stratum and COMAC projects are
already making use of P4 in innovative ways. More closely aligning our
activities will be of benefit to both communities, and we expect P4 to
play a pivotal role as we continue to pursue the broader
Next-Generation SDN agenda,” said Guru Parulkar, executive director
and board member of the Open Networking Foundation.

“P4.org helped grow the fledgling P4 language into the defacto
industry standard way to describe how switches, routers and NICs
process packets. The synergies with ONF are clear: Both organizations
develop community-owned open-source software for networking. It's time
for P4.org to be part of a larger, more established organization that
can keep it open, independent and steadily growing for many more years
to come. ", said Nick McKeown, Stanford Professor and co-founder and
board member of the ONF and P4.org.

#### Practical Impact for P4 Members

Practically speaking, moving the P4 project under the umbrella of the ONF is intended to be minimally disruptive to the P4 community.  Specifically:
* All the P4 properties are still active (like [p4.org](https://p4.org), [github.com/p4lang/](https://github.com/p4lang), etc.)
* All P4 mailing lists remain active
* All P4 working groups remain active and under the same leadership
* All P4 members can continue to work on all P4 related activities
* As before, no fees are required to continue to participate in all P4 activities

#### About P4.org

The P4 Language Consortium is a non-profit organization building a
thriving open source community dedicated to the use and improvement of
the P4 language. It helps promote standardization and improvement of
the P4 language and enables participants to develop new technologies
that function in accordance with the P4 language specification. P4.org
has over 100 members from industry and academia.
