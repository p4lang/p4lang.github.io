### Instructors

* Andy Fingerhut (Cisco Systems)
* Antonin Bas (Barefoot Networks)


### Software

We have created a Docker image that has all of the software needed to complete the tutorial exercises already installed.

* To download the Docker image:
    1. Install Docker

       [https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

       You may also find the instructions at the following links useful:

         * [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)
         * [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)
         * [Mac (dockerhub account required)](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

       ***When installing on Ubuntu, make sure you do the optional step 2 ("Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo").***

    1. Clone the p4app repository:

       `git clone --branch p4app --recurse-submodules https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials`

    1. Change directory to the first exercise:

       `cd tutorials/p4app-exercises/basic.p4app`

    1. Try running the first example. This will download the docker image and store it locally, so you will have it ready for the event. You should see a mininet prompt (`mininet>`) at the end:

       `make run`
