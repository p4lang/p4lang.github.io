#### Held at Cambridge, UK on September 23, 2019

EuroP4 2019 is the second P4 Language Consortium event in Europe.  
It aims to bring together P4 and P4->NetFPGA researchers from Europe and from around the world, and to foster the growth of the P4 Community.

EuroP4, which will run as a workshop at ANCS 2019, will have proceedings. It aims to enable researchers to publish early stage work and small scale projects and seeks three types of contributions:
* Papers  - up to 6 pages long (references included).
* Posters - up to 2 pages long (references included).
* Demos  - up to 2 pages long (references included).

Topics of an interest include, but are not limited to:
* All aspects of P4-based network protocol research including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.
* Contributions to network architecture using P4, e.g., specific algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.
* New applications and in-network computing enabled by P4
* P4-based and P4-NetFPGA based programmable data planes
* End-host networking with P4
* Tools and frameworks for development using P4
* Performance analysis and measurement of P4-based designs and systems
* Contributions to the evolution of the P4 language
