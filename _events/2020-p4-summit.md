### Hosted by the P4 Language Community and <br /> Open Networking Foundation  
#### Held at Stanford University on *Wednesday, April 29 and Thursday, April 30, 2020* 

We are excited to announce the new P4 Summit. With the growing interest and accelerated adoption of P4 and programmable forwarding across a growing number of use cases in networking, the event this year is being expanded to a two-day event rather than a separate P4 Workshop and P4 Developer Day. The breadth and depth of the content will include insightful keynotes; in-depth technical sessions on P4 and the tool chain; use cases for switching, NIC, and other network functions; hands-on tutorials; and live demonstrations of P4-enabled products. In moving to this new format, it will provide attendees with a broader perspective on important developments over the past year, insights on what is coming next, and an opportunity to socialize with P4 community members. 

Put it on your calendar now and don't miss it! 

### Program Chairs
* [Anirudh Sivaraman](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anirudh/), New York University
* [Larry Peterson](https://www.opennetworking.org/executive-team/#bio-Larry-Peterson), Open Networking Foundation
