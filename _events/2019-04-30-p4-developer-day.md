## Agenda

New for this year, we are offering two tracks for the developer day: a
beginner track and an advanced track. Both tracks will be delivered by
experienced instructors and using a software platform that will be
made available shortly before the Developer Day itself.

### Beginner Track

This track is for developers who are new to P4 and want a
tutorial-style introduction to the languages main features. It is
organized around a series of programming exercises in which
participants implement conventional and novel solutions to various
problems in networking including:

* Basic forwarding, tunneling, and source routing
* Load balancing
* Monitoring and telemetry
* P4Runtime

Only basic programming knowledge is required, but familiarity with
Python and using a Linux virtual machines will be helpful. For a sneak peek of last year's agenda, you can find it **[here](https://p4.org/events/2018-06-06-p4-developer-day/).** 

* To **[reserve a seat](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/p4-developer-day-2019-tickets-55431431905)** for this track, make sure to choose 'Beginner Track' from the drop-down menu during registration.

### Advanced Track

This track is for developers with intermediate knowledge of the P4
language. It is organized around a sequence of hands-on exercises that
show how to build a leaf-spine data center fabric based on Segment
Routing over IPv6 (SRv6), using the ONOS SDN controller:

* Basic forwarding
* Bridging
* SRv6
* ONOS Control Plane
* Testing in Mininet

Only basic knowledge of Java is required. The track will include a
brief introduction to ONOS for beginners. Participants will be
provided with a skeleton implementation of the applicationq to
complete, filling in the relevant parts to generate run-time table
entries and other entities to implement bridging and SRv6 capabilities. 

* To **[reserve a seat](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/p4-developer-day-2019-tickets-55431431905)** for this track, make sure to choose 'Advanced Track' from the drop-down menu during registration.

### Instructors

* Nate Foster (Cornell University)
* Brian O'Connor (ONF)
* Carmelo Cascone (ONF)
* And others (TBA)
