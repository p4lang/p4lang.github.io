### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium
    
#### Held at Cambridge, UK in conjunction with ICNP 2018 on September 24, 2018

### Agenda

The technical agenda will be announced closer to the workshop date but will include a keynote address, talks and demos, and a panel discussion.

### Call for Papers

The first P4EU workshop will bring together networking researchers to
discuss cutting-edge, P4-based, research. The workshop provides a
venue for P4-based research and projects, a place to discuss P4-based
tools, and the research community needs. The workshop aims to forge
connections between researchers, introduce more networking researchers
to the P4 community, and seed future top-tier publications and
innovation.

* All aspects of P4-based network protocol research including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.
* Contributions to network architecture using P4, e.g., specific algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.
* New applications and in-network computing enabled by P4
* P4-based and P4-NetFPGA based programmable data planes
* Tools and frameworks for development using P4
* Performance and performance constraints of P4 based designs


#### Important Dates

* Abstract registration: June 15th, 2018
* Submission deadline: June 22nd, 2018
* Acceptance notification: July 21st, 2018
* Camera ready: August 15th, 2018


#### Submission Instructions

P4EU 2018 will use a double-blind review process. Papers should adhere to the IEEE formatting requirements and should not exceed 6 pages. Authors are required to present accepted papers at the workshop, and at least one author is required to register, at the full rate, in order for the paper to appear in the proceedings and the IEEE digital library. One of the authors MUST present the accepted paper at the workshop. Exceptions from this policy for truly mitigating situations must be approved by the TPC Chairs before the beginning of the workshop.
