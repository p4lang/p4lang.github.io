### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium and ONF in conjunction with CoNEXT 2020

#### Held online on December 1, 2020

EuroP4 2020 is the third P4 Language Consortium event in Europe.
It aims to bring together P4 and P4->NetFPGA researchers from Europe and from around the world, and to foster the growth of the P4 Community.

Topics of an interest include, but are not limited to:
* All aspects of P4-based network protocol research, including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.
* Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures using P4 as a basis, e.g., specific algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.
* New applications enabled by P4, including in-network computing and Big Data, Video and Virtual Reality, Mobile and Wireless Network Protocols and Applications, Ubiquitous computing, Internet-of-Things and Smart Cities.
* Secure, reliable and dependable P4-based systems, including all aspects of monitoring, verification, debugging and troubleshooting networks enabled by P4.
* P4-based and P4-NetFPGA based programmable data planes.
* P4 end-host networking, offloading transport- and application-layer protocols to P4-enabled hardware.
* Tools and frameworks for development using P4.
* Contributions to the evolution of the P4 language.
