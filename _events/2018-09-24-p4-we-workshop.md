### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium and ONF in conjunction with ICNP 2018 
    
#### Held at Cambridge, UK on September 24, 2018

P4WE 2018 is the first P4 Language Consortium event in European. It aims to bring together P4 and P4->NetFPGA researchers from Europe and from around the world, and to foster the growth of the P4 Community.

P4WE, which will run as a workshop at ICNP 2018, will have proceedings. It aims to enable researchers to publish early stage work and small scale projects.

### Venue

University of Cambridge  
Department of Computer Science and Technology  
The Computer Laboratory  
William Gates Building  
15 JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0FD

        Abstract
        </summary>
	In four years, P4 has evolved from being a paper proposal to being a
	packet processing programming language with increasing adoption
	worldwide, overseen by the P4 Language Consortium (P4.org).  The talk
	will first overview developments over this period, which have brought
	the community to the current P4_16 language specification, the PSA
	(Portable Switch Architecture) specification, and the P4Runtime API
	specification.  It will then discuss some current community efforts to
	extend the reach of P4.  One of the key developments in 2017 was
	language-architecture separation, leading to the P4_16 (language) and
	PSA (architecture) threads.  In practice, NICs (Network Interface
	Cards, notably Smart NICs) are a common target, so one community goal
	is to define a PNA (portable NIC architecture) specification, to
	complement the existing PSA specification.  Then, a bigger picture is
	to extend P4 to allow the description of architectures, which is the
	goal of the Programmable Target Architecture (PTA) research project of
	Stanford and Xilinx Labs.  The talk will describe this project, and a
	current prototype that compiles extended P4 descriptions to FPGA-based
	hardware implementations.  An important test case for the new approach
	will be the expression of both PSA and PNA (when ultimately defined)
	in the extended “P4 +” rather than in English as currently.
	Currently, P4 is focused on packet processing – through parsing,
	match-action pipelines, and deparsing.  Another current research
	project, involving MIT, NYU, Stanford, and Xilinx Labs, concerns
	extending P4 (language and architecture) to cover Traffic Management –
	providing programmable scheduling, shaping, policing, queueing, etc.
	The talk will overview this project, and a current prototype based on
	the PIFO scheduling model that was presented at SIGCOMM 2016.
	Finally, the talk will consider future evolution of the open source
	community around P4, including the development of comprehensive
	reference examples for both switch and NIC architectures, for both
	software and programmable hardware implementations.

        Biography
        </summary>
	Gordon Brebner is a Distinguished Engineer at Xilinx, Inc., the
	technology leader in highly flexible and adaptive processing
	platforms.  He works in Xilinx Labs, leading an international group
	researching issues surrounding networked and trusted processing
	systems of the future. His main personal research interests concern
	dynamically reconfigurable architectures, domain-specific languages
	with highly concurrent implementations, and high performance
	networking and telecommunications.  His group’s research led to the
	Xilinx SDNet product for P4-programmable networking at scalable 1G
	to 1T rates.  He holds around 40 patents, and has published around
	60 papers, in the general area of networking with FPGAs.  Prior to
	joining Xilinx in 2002, he was the Professor of Computer Systems and
	Head of the Department of Computer Science at the University of
	Edinburgh, and remains an Honorary Professor of Informatics there.
	He is an active contributor to the P4 language Consortium (P4.org),
	including co-chairing the P4 Language Design working group from its
	inception.  He received the inaugural P4.org Distinguished Service
	Award in 2018.
