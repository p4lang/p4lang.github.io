<h1 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started With P4</h1>

<p><strong>What</strong> is P4?</p>
<ul>
<li>P4 is a programming language to describe packet processing. It is commonly used to specify how network devices, such as switches and routers, should process packets in the data plane.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who</strong> should learn P4?</p>
<ul>
<li>Network device manufacturers</li>
<li>Network operators</li>
<li>Researchers interested in: new network applications, switch design, programming languages</li>
<li>Teachers / students that would like to teach / learn about the fundamentals of computer networking while obtaining hands-on experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why</strong> should I learn P4?</p>
<ul>
<li>P4 is becoming widely adopted as the de facto standard for describing the packet processing functionality of network devices. As its adoption continues to grow in both industry and academia, it will become more and more important to understand how to read and write P4 programs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where</strong> can I learn P4?</p>
<ul>
<li>The rest of this page will walk through some hands-on tutorial exercises using open source software that is free to download.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When</strong> should I learn P4?</p>
<ul>
<li>Now!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="handsontutorials">Hands-on Tutorials</h1>
<p>We've put together some introductory material to help you get started learning P4.
