The P4 community is proud to make available a wealth of software
packages that enable you to get started on your data-plane programming
journey.

## Tutorials and Example Programs

A good starting point is our rich set of <a
href="https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials">tutorials</a>. Our
tutorials are developed as hands-on labs, and contain everything to
get you started with experimenting in P4: an overview of the language,
sets of exercises that increase in complexity, and a virtual machine
pre-installed with all the software such that you can directly jump
into data-plane programming.

We have also released a data-center <a
href="https://github.com/p4lang/switch">switch</a> definition. It
supports a large number of features, from L2/L3 processing, to
Multicast, MPLS, ACL, SFLOW and even In-band Network Telemetry (INT).

## P4 Compiler

- The <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c">P4C compiler</a> for both
    P4<sub>14</sub> and P4<sub>16</sub> language variants. The
    compiler supports several backends:
   - p4c-bmv2 -- targets the
        <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model">behavioral
          model</a>
   - p4c-ebpf -- targets the Extended Berkeley Packet Framework
   - p4c-graphs -- produces parser and table flow graph
        diagrams, and
   - p4test -- a simple frontend verifier for P4 programs.
    The infrastructure is designed to easily integrate vendor specific
    backends.

## Behavioral Model (BMv2)

- The <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model">behavioral
    model</a>, a simulation environment to run the P4 software switch,
    standalone or in Mininet. The behavioral model is an extensible
    framework that currently supports a P4<sub>14</sub> pipeline
    (simple_switch). However it allows you to easily simulate
    new archiectures by implementing new externs and enabling you to
    organize the forwarding elements as needed.

## P4Runtime

- The specification and Protobuf/gRPC interface definitions for
    <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime">P4Runtime</a>, a runtime API
    and protocol for controlling data-plane programs.
- A <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/PI">reference implementation</a> for
    P4Runtime.

## Packet Test Framework (PTF)

- A <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/ptf">packet testing
    framework</a> (PTF), written in Python, that enables configuring a
    switch and creating tests that send, receive, and verify packets
    of different formats. PTF interfaces with P4 Runtime.

## P4 Container

- <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4app">P4app</a>, a Docker
    container pre-packaged with a development environment that makes
    it easy to compile and deploy P4 programs using simple
    configuration rules.

## GitHub

Please feel free to browse around our <a
href="https://github.com/p4lang">github repositories</a>. All our code

## Getting Involved

As your interest grows, we encourage you to participate and contribute
your code. Please join the <a
href="http://lists.p4.org/mailman/listinfo/p4-dev_lists.p4.org">P4
Developer</a> mailing list to get updates, ask questions, and get
answers.  Our <a href="projects.html">community projects</a> include a
variety of tasks that can give you ideas on where to start
contributing. Note that you or your organization must be a P4
[member](/join-us/) in order for us to accept your contributions.
