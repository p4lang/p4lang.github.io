#### DIG IN

Participation is all about getting started.  We recommend you start by joining appropriate mailing lists and getting your hands dirty with the [code](https://github.com/p4lang). 

The P4 mailing lists are:
* <a href="http://lists.p4.org/pipermail/p4-announce_lists.p4.org/">p4-announce</a> : general admin list: meeting schedules, announcements of significant contributions (low-volume, <a href="http://lists.p4.org/mailman/listinfo/p4-announce_lists.p4.org">subscribe here</a>)

#### ONF Membership

P4 is a project hosted by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF).  ONF Membership is not required to participate in P4 activities, but there are a few ways to more fully engage with the ONF community. 

You can get recognized as an ONF Collaborator if you propose an active contribution and/or just let us know about where and how you have been active.  Click here for more information on becoming an [ONF Collaborator](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Collaboration+Recognition).

ONF Membership allows organizations to more fully support P4 and the ONFâ€™s activities.  It also provides access to member-only activities and resources.  You can learn more here about becoming an [ONF member](https://www.opennetworking.org/membership-info/).
