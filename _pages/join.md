#### ONF Membership

P4 is a project hosted by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF).  ONF Membership is not required to participate in P4 activities, but there are a few ways to more fully engage with the ONF community. 

You can get recognized as an ONF Collaborator if you propose an active contribution and/or just let us know about where and how you have been active.  Click here for more information on becoming an [ONF Collaborator](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Collaboration+Recognition).

ONF Membership allows organizations to more fully support P4 and the ONF’s activities.  It also provides access to member-only activities and resources.  You can learn more here about becoming an [ONF member](https://www.opennetworking.org/membership-info/).
