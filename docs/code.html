P4.org is proud to make available a wealth of software packages that
enable you to get started on your data-plane programming journey.

A good starting point is our rich set
of <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials">tutorials</a>. Our
tutorials are developed as hands-on labs, and contain everything to
get you started with experimenting in P4: an overview of the language,
sets of exercises that increase in complexity, and a virtual machine
pre-installed with all the software such that you can directly
jump into data-plane programming.

For the developer in you, we have made available all our software, so
that you can start customizing it to your needs. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>P4 code examples, including a
    data-center <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/switch">switch</a>
    definition. It supports a large number of features, from L2/L3
    processing, to Multicast, MPLS, ACL, SFLOW and even In-band
    Network Telemetry (INT).</li>

  <li>The P4C <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c">compiler</a> for both
    P4<sub>14</sub> and P4<sub>16</sub> language variants</li>. The
    compiler supports several backends: p4c-bmv2 that targets the
    <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model">behavioral
    simulator</a>, p4c-ebpf that targets
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter">Extended
    Berkeley Packet Framework</a>, p4c-graphs that produces parser and
    table flow graph diagrams, and p4test -- a simple frontend
    verifier for P4 programs.

  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model">simulation</a>
    environment (BMv2) to run the P4 software switch, standalone or in
    Mininet. BMv2 is an extensible framework that currently supports a
    P4<sub>14</sub> pipeline (simple_switch). However it allows you to
    easily simulate additional externs by extending its modular
    system.</li>

  <li>The specification and reference implementation
  for <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/PI">P4 Runtime, a runtime API
  and protocol for controlling data-plane programs.</li>

  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/ptf">packet testing
    framework</a> (PTF), written in Python, that enables configuring a
    switch and creating tests that send, receive, and verify packets
    of different formats. PTF interfaces with P4 Runtime.</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4app">P4app</a>, an
    environment to tie it all together and deploy it using simple
    configuration rules.</li>
</ul>

And much more. Please feel free to browse around
our <a href="https://github.com/p4lang">github repositories</a>. All

your code. Please join
