P4.org work is done though volunteering in working groups. Working groups are formed around a theme. They define a charter that typically includes both code projects and specification work. There are currently 4 working groups:

## P4 Language Working group

Responsible for the language definition and the P4C compiler.

## P4 Architecture Working group

Responsible for the definition of the Portable Switch Architecture
PSA, the backend compiler and support in the behavioral model.

## P4 API Working group

Responsible for the definition of the P4Runtime API, and a reference
implementation for client and server libraries.

## P4 Applications Working group

Responsible for the definition of data-plane telemetry technologies
(common formats and semantics), P4 sample code for data-plane
telemetry and test cases that validate it against the specification.
